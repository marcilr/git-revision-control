Git cloning into current directory [duplicate]


You don't need to clone the repository,
you need to add remote and then add the
files to the repository.

git init
git remote add origin <remote_url>
git fetch --all --prune
git checkout master
git add -A .
git commit -m "Adding my files..."


In details:
You already have a remote repository and you want
to add files to this repository.

1. First you have to "tell" git that the current
directory is a git repository
  git init

2. Then you need to tell git what is the url of 
the remote repository
  git remote add origin <remote_url>

3. Now you will need to grab the content of the
remote repository (all the content - branches,
tags etc)
  git fetch --all --prune

4. Check out the desired branch (master in this example)
  git checkout <branch>

5. Add the new files to the current <branch> git add -A .

6. Commit your changes git commit

7. Upload your changes back to the remote repository git push origin <branch>
