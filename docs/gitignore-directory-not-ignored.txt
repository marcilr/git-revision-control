================================
Under the primary ~/git directory I observed that the html/ repo
was not being ignored despite having an entry in the ~/git/.gitignore file:


Inspect "Untracked files" for html/ repo under main ~/git/ repo:
$ cd ~/git
~/git$ git status html
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~/git$

The above "Untracked files:" was desplayed dispite html/ being 
in ~/git/.gitignore:

~/git$ less .gitignore
...
html/
...

The solution was to add the html/ repo, under the ~/git repo, 
using 'git add -f html', commit, and archive repo to github
with git push:

~/git$ git add -f html
~/git$ git commit
[master ca1ae67] Added to alleviate "Untracked files" error despite html/ being in .gitignore:
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 120000 html
marcilr@malachite:~/git$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Looks good.
