Colorize git status output for filenames


Was having a real hard time read untracked filenames,
that were red on black, in 'git status' output.

Discovered it was easy to set the color using
"git config color.status.*" commands as follows:


Very hard to see plain blue:
$ git config color.status.changed blue

Better:
$ git config color.status.changed white

Best:
$ git config color.status.changed "blue normal bold"

Best"
$ git config color.status.untracked "green normal bold"
