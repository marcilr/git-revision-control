Symbolic links in git


"There is an important caveat when creating symlinks that are
meant to be tracked under Git.  The reference path of the
source file should be relative to the repository, not absolute
to the machine.

  # Not good for Git repositories
  ln -s /Users/gio/repo/foo.md ./bar/foo.md

  # Good for Git repositories
  cd ./bar && ln -s ../foo.md foo.md

The reason for this is that given that a symlink contains the
path to the referenced file, if the path is relative to a
specific machine the link won't work on others.  If it's
relative to the repository itself on the other hand, the OS
will always be able to find the source."
